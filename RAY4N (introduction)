       <h1>Who?</h1>
       <p>Im Rayan and I come from The Netherlands, Im currently 16 and will be 17 at the end of this year (2024) </p>
       <h2>Positives</h2>
       <p>Respectful, Honest, Caring, Kind, Trustworthy, Passionate, Friendly, Smart, Social, Loyal, Humble and most likely more I don't know of.</p>
       <p>Trust me if theres something wrong you can tell me it will not spread to anyone. I always look out for my closest friends. Even if you are just an known to me you'll be appreciated from my perspective.</p>
       <p>Im not the person that goes full chat mode with someone they just know. I'd like to talk small first with someone when I don't know them. After the "First stage" I'll probably talk alot more, be more open and be more enthousiastic </p>
       <p>I don't claim team wins on myself. I know who got me here and will always thank them and credit them. I don't like the idea of breaking someones heart after they went through alot just for me to take the stage and not credit them </p>
       <p>If you did something for me trust me ill be in your debt and I really thank you enough for even doing something for me.</p>
       <p>My last bit on Positives, If you are a friend of mine just know you are thankful by me for just being a known/friend.</p>
       <h2>Negatives</h2>
       <p>Friends often say that I can be ego, Bias, Impatient. I often don't think I can be ego since I always try to see how their world perspective is. Sadly I don't see this all the time and sometimes to my friends too since I just know that as "Friends". Its pretty hard to explain.</p>
       <p>I agree being often bias about my own opinions. I just don't like the fact that I lose. Sadly I must learn that everyone loses wether if its about an argument or anything else. It can happen </p>
       <p>I am not that often impatient but I can be.</p>
       <h2>Likings?</h2>
       <p>I like hitting the gym, Cycle now and then, Chicken and games ofc</p>
       <h2>Depression?</h2>
       <p>I don't really think I had depression, Ofcourse I had some ups and downs. But mananged to make my life way better by just being in a cut. I was overweight like 1-2 years ago since I was 10 I think.</p>
       <p>Since December 2023 I've made the switch to track my calories and its been going good so far. In those 8 months now i've seen like unbelieveable progress. Im not overweight anymore I look skinny but muscular. Ofcourse I do think I got body dysmorphia which I don't think is going away sadly</p>
       <p>but i can say that I really love how I progressed and that is what keeps me really up most of the times. Often my downs are my acne that sometimes just keeps going mayhem but I use products for that.</p>
       <p>I also just have some little bits of dandruff which I really hate and that most of the times makes me go into a downspiral again.</p>
       <h2>Insecurities?</h2>
       <p>I have a few, Since I do have some sort of body dysmorphia I always think im still fat, Yet close friends still say im pretty skinny. I think this is just something that cannot or can be avoided during weight/fatloss.</p>
       <p>I really hate the fact that I have dandruff. It just keeps me hating on my hair even though I use doctor's products to remove it. I think im not consistent enough with that though. </p>
       <p>As for other things I sometimes just think im not perfect and thats completely fine. Everyone isn't perfect. Thereby I just often think that my nose is just big or wide but its perfectly fine.</p>
       <p>How i've countered this is by thinking what other people think. Are there people complaining about your nose? Then yes your nose might be a point what people don't like about your appearance. Are they not complaining or do they think that your nose is beautiful then know theres nothing wrong with your nose </p>
       <p>Or if theres a friend that gets into a argument with you and they start talking about your appearance like your chin being big or that your face is crooked, Then that <b>Might</b>be some point where people see your imperfect feature</p>
       <p>Sadly that is unavoidable and you need to be happy with your face or whatever. Just know you are special.</p>
       <h2>Studying?</h2>
       <p>Im currently going to intermediate vocational education (just highschool or something like that) for 3 (maybe 2) years studying software developer</p>
       <p>After those 2/3 years ill be doing Higher professional education (high-highschool) which ill be studing software engineer and after that ill be heading for my masters certification and then uni</p>
       <h2>Music?</h2>
       <p>I listen alot of music and the type or genre than vary very far from each other.</p>
       <p>Sometimes I like to listen to classical, Smooth Jazz, Pop and a bunch of other genre</p>
       <p>I think the type of music im going to listen to really depends on the mood</p>
       <p>At the moment of writing this whole html file I were to be listening to nujabes which is really good at making "calm" music</p>
       <h2>Games?</h2>
       <p>I play lots of different games such as Roblox, GTA, Rainbow Six Siege, CSGO, Minecraft etc. I can name a pretty long list, However I don't play all those games nonstop</p>
       <p>I play Roblox often but most of the times with friends. Minecraft comes in with periods of 2 weeks with friends. Rainbow Six Siege is my currently most played game since I love the game so much with CSGO coming next.</p>
       <p>Ofcourse I can name all the games i've played but it would be better if you would've checked it out on my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/RxY4N/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Ofcourse I have other platforms too but Steam is where my most played games are.</p>
       <h2>Gym?</h2>
       <p>I really gym alot and some friends call me out on it since I just skip some nights spending time with them. I don't do this because I hate them but rather I don't see a big value of just chatting inside in the long-term.</p>
       <p>I'd rather just work on my body to feel good about myself than chatting for a couple minutes.</p>
       <p>Currently I train Chest and Back (2 major musclegroups iknow) on the monday, Rest for tuesday, Chest and Triceps for the wednesday, thursday rest and on the friday my most favourite day back and biceps which I really enjoy working on. </p>
        <p> After that we got the saturday where i'll train legs and on the sunday doing shoulders and arms (Including Biceps, Triceps and forearms) </p>
       <p>My mosted liked muscle groups to train is the back and shoulders. Both make you look broader which for me thankfully I had already such genetic as broad shoulders.</p>
       <p> For supplements I just take Creatine with water ofc, Protein powder to get atleast some protein in, and some days pre-workout to just be energized</p>
       <h2>Hobbies?</h2>
       <p>I don't really know what to specifiy as hobbies now. Ofcourse I like cycling, gaming going to the gym. I often play soccer with friends.I rarely read books, I like books with a information aspect to it.</p>
       <p>I've had 1 amazing book that I still need to complete and it is about space. I really like to admire space itself, Just knowing theres probably a better and habitable planet than earth which is even larger.</p>
       <p>Sadly I don't think we're getting close to a new universe anytime soon in our lifetimes. I always love space and even nature too since they're both interesting.</p>
       <h2>Work?</h2>
       <p> I deliver pizza's to someones house if they ordered it</p>
       <h2>Dreams?</h2>
       <p>My current dream is to be successful in life, By building up my own software corporation which I hope to do. Where I should not have to worry about money. Or having my dream physique. I really fancy the idea of having my own cars too.</p>
       <p>A daily car like Mercedes AMG GLE Coupe, Sports car like BMW M4 G82 and as luxury the Mercedes Maybach GLS. </p>
       <h2>Future?</h2>
       <p>I hope to have some sort of own business with alot of connections, Being an expert in software engineering. Sadly this is all what im hoping for.</p>
       <p>Currently I'm working towards buying my first car when I reach 18. Thinking for a oldtimer BMW but known for their fast repairs im still in the choosing phase.</p>
       <p>I also hope that I can finally start being into the whole programming things since I don't really am consistent with programming. I do think this is due that I am not forced to do it and just rather let it fall into the void.</p>

       <h2> I don't really know what to put anymore and pretty much explained myself here.</h2>
